# FiFa20-reprository-project

This is an analysis of Fifa20 online gaming platform data. This project required me to take on the role of an analyst at Careerfoundry, during this process I need to source for open-data with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, I’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test the hypotheses. The results was presented in Tableau dashboard.

## Analysis Criteria
Conducting the following analyses in this Achievement (note that not all results need to be included in the final dashboard):

* Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots and categorical plots)
* Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
* Regression analysis
* Cluster analysis
* Time-series analysis
* Final presentation on Tableau dashboad

## Tools:

The following python libraries used for this project were:
* Anaconda - library manager for Python
* Pandas - for data analysis
* Seaborn - for visualizing the data.

## Executing code:

Codes executed using jupyter notebooks by 
* Running of codes
* Importing of data
* Exporting of data
